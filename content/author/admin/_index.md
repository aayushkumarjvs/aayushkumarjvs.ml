Hi, I'm Aayush, an undergrad at SRM IST, India, pursuing engineering in Information Technology.

I love to develop open-source software and sometimes surf Github more than facebook or twitter. Collaborating with people and making new things makes me happy! I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Software Development, Open Source and all things related to technology. I love challenges, competitions and creating an organized schedule for completing a task. Currently, I am working in the field of Data Analysis and Data Minning, I also love to work on Computer Vision and Natural Language Understanding related problems. 

In my free time, I love to jogüèÉ, read booksüìö, listen to music or podcastsüéß, watch moviesüìΩÔ∏è and solo travellingüó∫Ô∏è
