I'm Atibhi, an undergrad at IIIT Bangalore pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering.

I love FOSS and sometimes surf github more than instagram. Collaborating with people and making new things makes me happy ! I am passionate about Machine Learning, Software Development, Open Source and all things tech related. In my free time, I take part in hackathons and come up with intelligent solutions to tackle day-to-day problems. I love challenges and enjoy creating an organized schedule for completing a task. Presently, I am working in the field of Visual Recognition(VR) and NLP. I am working on abstractive summarization of NPTEL transcripts so that students can get the gist of the video from the text itself instead of going through the entire video. I have also done Software Engineering internships at IISc and was one of the 13 teams in the world to become a Rails Girls Summer of Code Scholar in 2018.

In my free time, I love reading, listening to music and travelling. I sometimes like to imagine I'm the real life Monica Geller and start organizing things with vengeance.
